## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site’s `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-theme-nyx"
```

Then install the gem:

```sh
bundle install
```

Next, enable the theme in your _config.yml:

```yml
theme: jekyll-theme-nyx
```

And that's how you start to use Nyx!

## Editing Configs

At the moment, the `_config.yml` file is pretty sparse. The only thing in it that you might want to edit is the `title`. In `_config.yml`, put `title: Your Site's Name`.

In the future there will be more fields you can add to your website, so be sure to stay tuned for updates!
