# Contributing to Nyx

First of all, thanks for contributing!

## How to Contribute (High Level)

1. **Identify a problem or improvement**
2. **Open or claim an issue**
3. **Fork the repo**
4. **Create a branch**
5. **Make your changes**
6. **Open a pull request**

If you do not open or claim an issue, your pull request will likely be rejected.

## Issues Come First

Before you open a PR, **there should be an issue**.

This applies if you are:
- Fixing a bug
- Adding a feature
- Refactoring existing behavior
- Changing styling, layout, or structure in a non-trivial way

### Why?
- It prevents duplicate work
- It lets us agree on direction before code is written
- It gives context to your PR
- It creates a paper trail for future contributors

### What to do:
- If an issue already exists comment on it and say you’re working on it
- If no issue exists open one
- If you’re unsure open an issue anyway and ask

> Small things like typo fixes can skip the issue step. Use your judgment.

## Fork & Branch

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a branch from `main`

```bash
git checkout -b fix/my-short-description
```

Please use clear branch names.

## Making Changes

A few expectations:

- Follow the existing code style
- Don’t reformat unrelated files
- Keep commits focused and meaningful
- If you change behavior, explain why in the commit or PR

If your change affects:
- layout
- tags/categories
- syntax highlighting
- build behavior

…please call that out clearly in your PR description.
## Testing

Before opening a PR:

- Run the site locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- Click around
- Check mobile widths
- Verify tags, categories, and posts still render correctly

## Opening a Pull Request

When opening your PR:

- Reference the issue it fixes (e.g. Fixes #12)
- Explain what you changed
- Explain why you changed it
- Include screenshots if it’s visual
- Keep it scoped — one PR, one purpose

Please fill out the PR template when opening a pull request. That helps us with understanding what your PR is trying to do. PRs without context or without an associated issue may be closed or sent back for clarification.

# Philosophy

Nyx aims to be:

- Minimal
- Understandable
- Hackable without too many plugins
- Predictable in structure

If your contribution makes things more magical but harder to reason about, it probably doesn’t fit. If you’re unsure, open an issue and ask.
